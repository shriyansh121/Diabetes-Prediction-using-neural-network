# Diabetes-Prediction-using-neural-network
I implemented diabetes prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), utilizing both Sequential and Functional APIs in TensorFlow/Keras. This approach allowed flexibility in designing and optimizing the model architecture for accurate classification of diabetes cases.

The dataset belongs to National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The Pima Indians, a Native American tribe, traditionally inhabited the Gila River region in Arizona. Known for their agricultural practices, they have faced significant health challenges, including high diabetes prevalence, in modern times. The dataset aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients using specific diagnostic measurements. It focuses exclusively on females aged 21 or older of Pima Indian heritage, with carefully curated instances selected from a broader database.

## Content 
The dataset contains multiple medical predictor variables and a target variable, Outcome. Predictors include factors like the patient's number of pregnancies, BMI, insulin levels, age, and other diagnostic metrics.
